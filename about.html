      <h2>Regarding Mardi Gras</h2>
      <p>
        The first record of Mardi Gras being celebrated in Louisiana was at the
        mouth of the Mississippi River in what is now lower Plaquemines Parish,
        Louisiana, on March 2, 1699. <br />
        Mardi Gras in New Orleans is a one to three month stretch of the year in
        which the streets come alive with music, art, and costumed revelers.
        Beginning on Twelfth Night, January 6, the best season of the year is
        upon us: king cake, bead-tossing, and parading begins and only increases
        as we make our way toward Mardi Gras Day. This year the season is a long
        one, with Mardi Gras Day on March 1, 2022. There’s so much to celebrate
        during Carnival season, where locals rule and visitors are more than
        welcome to join in on the fun. On the weekends leading up to Fat
        Tuesday, parades roll all over town. Spectators gasp at the colossal
        Endymion floats and delight in the political satire of Krewe du Vieux.
        There’s something to do during every week of the Mardi Gras season.
        Whether it's new traditions like Krewe of Chewbacchus (with its Star
        Wars-inspired tomfoolery) or decades-old stalwarts Zulu and Rex (which
        celebrates its 150th anniversary this year), visitors are encouraged to
        explore our Mardi Gras traditions. Some of our favorite ways to do this?
        Try ten different slices of king cake, stand in awe of community walking
        krewes, and make new friendships with your neighbors on the route. This
        is the place to have the authentic Mardi Gras experience.

        As Mayor of the great City of New Orleans, I invite you to visit our
        city to experience the excitement of Mardi Gras! The Carnival season
        officially begins each year on Jan. 6 -- the Feast of the Epiphany, also
        called Twelfth Night or Kings’ Day. Traditional balls are held in the
        weeks leading up to the big event. Spectacular parades with colorful,
        creative floats start rolling before Mardi Gras Day. Our private
        Carnival clubs, called krewes, take on royalty status and throw beads,
        doubloons and toys to parade goers. Visitors quickly learn to say,
        "Throw me something mister!" The culmination of Mardi Gras in New
        Orleans begins early on Mardi Gras Day when the Zulu Social Aid &
        Pleasure Club and the Rex Organization parade through the city. Music,
        food and elaborate costumes add to the fun-filled day of excitement for
        revelers of all ages. New Orleans, with its unmatched culture and
        world-famous music and cuisine, is an exciting place to be at any time
        of the year. We invite everyone to experience Mardi Gras at least once
        in their lifetime. Make your plans now to be a part of this great
        tradition and see firsthand why we say, "Laissez les bon temps
        rouler!"<br /><br />
        <b>Sincerely, LaToya Cantrell Mayor of New Orleans</b>
