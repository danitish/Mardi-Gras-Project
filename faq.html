              The Carnival season always begins on <strong>Jan. 6</strong> ,
              which is King’s Day (Feast of the Epiphany). Mardi Gras day (Fat
              Tuesday), however, is on a different day each year. <br />
              <br />
              Fat Tuesday changes every year because Easter Sunday is never on
              the same Sunday each year. Fat Tuesday is always the day before
              Ash Wednesday. <br />
              <br />
              Most visitors plan to arrive no later than the Saturday prior to
              Mardi Gras day and stay through Ash Wednesday.

              The weather during Mardi Gras can vary from very cold to very
              warm, almost hot. Sometimes it will change from one extreme to the
              other during the same day. It’s a good idea to layer your clothes
              since a chilly morning may turn into a warm afternoon. <br />
              <br />
              Since you will be spending long days outside, pack comfortable
              shoes and clothes that can get somewhat dirty. Don’t forget to
              check the forecast for rain. If storms are predicted, then you’ll
              definitely want to bring a raincoat!

              The weekend before Fat Tuesday is the prime time to visit New
              Orleans for Mardi Gras. This is the weekend when Bacchus and
              Endymion, two of the biggest parades of the season, roll down the
              streets of New Orleans. The streets are packed all day Saturday
              and Sunday with parade watchers. If you can stay longer than a
              weekend, Monday (Lundi Gras) and Fat Tuesday are also great days
              to experience Mardi Gras. Orpheus, another big parade, rolls on
              that Monday night, and the Zulu Lundi Gras festival goes on all
              day. On Fat Tuesday, walking around the French Quarter and seeing
              all of the costumes and masks is a unique and thrilling
              experience.

              By all means, yes! Contrary to public perception, Mardi Gras is a
              family celebration. Those of us who grew up in New Orleans feel
              guilty once our children have grown up and we continue going to
              every parade because we used to use "taking the children" as our
              excuse! Bring big bags (even large garbage bags!) to hold all of
              the stuff they will catch. Throws often include toys, stuffed
              animals, beads, and more. <br />
              <br />
              The only place you should avoid with kids is the French Quarter
              (where no full-size parades pass anyway). We recommend seeing the
              parades when they begin on St. Charles Avenue near Napoleon since
              parades can last until 11 p.m. near the end of the route.

              There is not a single official Mardi Gras theme since there is no
              single organization in charge of Mardi Gras. Each parade krewe
              decides on its own theme each year, which is often kept secret
              until the parade. Their costumes, floats, some of their throws,
              and their "official" Mardi Gras poster (if they have one) reflect
              this theme. For example, after 9/11, patriotic themes were
              popular.
